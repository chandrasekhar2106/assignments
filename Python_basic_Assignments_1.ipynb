    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans : A variable stores the information where as string  is one of the type of information to be stored in a variable.\n",

    "                    immutable where has lists are mutable. Tuples are represented by parenthesis().\n",
    "            Sets:  Sets are unordered collection data type that is iterable and mutable and has no duplicate values.\n",
    "            Dictionary: Dictionay is an unordered collection of data types used to store data values like key:value pairs.\n",
    "            Lists: Lists is an ordred collection of data. Which is represented in sqaure brackets.\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The expressions are made up of variables, operators and values. They generally used to perform methematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The statemet is where we declare as spam = 10 and Expression is more assigning value to a variable \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "    bacon = 22\n",
    "    bacon + 1\n",

    "'spam'+'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam'*3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : For both we will get 'spamspamspam'\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Because a variable cannot start with a number\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: int() float()  str()\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "    'chandra'+ 99 + 'sekhar'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Because a string cannot concatinate with integer. to fix this convert int into str then the problem will be resolved.\n",
    "     'chandra'+ '99' + 'sekhar' this will works.\n",
